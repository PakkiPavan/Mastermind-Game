Mastermind game

•	At the beginning of each game the computer generates a secret code of four colors. The colors are always chosen from the same six colors. Duplicates are not allowed.
•	The objective is to guess the secret code. We will have to guess the colors and put them in the same order as they are in the secret code.
•	Choose four colors in the next available row and then click on the Check button. The computer will score your guess in the following way:
  o	For each guess that is right in both color and position you get a black point
  o	For each guess that is right in color but not in position you get a red point
•	You have twelve rows to make your guesses, if you exhaust all of them without guessing the code, you lost the game.
